# vue-project-1

A very basic little game built with Vue.js with quasar framework.

We fight against a monster and once ‘start new game’ button been clicked, we got the ability to ‘attack’, to make a ‘special attack’, to ‘heal’ or to ‘give up’. If I attack, I do a random amount of damage logged down there and I also take some damage as the monster has a chance to attack me. I can also launch a special attack and if I take too much damage of course, I can heal up here, you can see that the monster still attacks me but overall, I should gain some health at least. And if I get a feeling this all is not ending well, I can always give up and therefore start a new game. Finally either I lose or win, the message alert in window, and the page render back to default.
